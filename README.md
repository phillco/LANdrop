LANdrop
=======

**LANdrop** is a fast, dead-simple utility to send files to people over LAN. No registration, no IP addresses, no cloud...just open the dialog, drag the file over to their name, and you're done!

LANdrop started as a small [student project](https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/p2pfiletransfer), but it was so useful that we've decided to expand and release it. We're rewriting it in C# to build a killer UX, but the protocol will be open to allow other native clients, too.

This version is currently under development and isn't really usable yet.
